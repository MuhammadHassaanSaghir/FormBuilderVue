# Vue.js Form Builder

## Overview
The **Vue.js Form Builder** is a customizable form creation tool that allows users to create forms through a drag-and-drop interface. These forms can be embedded into websites using an iframe or exported as code in various frameworks like HTML, Vue, React, or Angular. The project is designed to make form creation easier for developers and non-developers.

## Features
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Easily create forms by dragging and dropping fields into the form builder.
- **Customizable Fields**: Each field can have custom attributes such as labels, placeholders, and required validation.
- **Persistent Data**: The form data is stored in the browser's local storage, allowing users to update their forms without losing progress.
- **Code Generation** (Coming Soon): Export the created forms into HTML, Vue, React, or Angular code to use directly in your projects.
- **Field Types**: Currently supports basic form fields like text inputs, checkboxes, and more.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MuhammadHassaanSaghir/FormBuilderVue.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd form-builder
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run serve
## Usage
1. Once the server is running, you can access the Form Builder at http://localhost:8080.
2. Use the drag-and-drop interface to add fields to your form.
3. Customize field attributes like label, placeholder, and required validation.
4. The form data is automatically saved in the browser's local storage, so your progress is persisted across sessions.
## Future Plans
- **Export Feature**: Enable users to export the generated forms as embeddable code for websites or framework-specific code for easy integration with popular frontend technologies.
- **Extended Field Options**: Add more field types, customizable validation rules, and style configurations.
- **Backend Integration**: Eventually, support for backend integration to save form submissions to a database or external service will be considered.
